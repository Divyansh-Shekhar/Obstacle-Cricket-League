	In OCL, a total of 5 teams have competed, namely "United Stars", "United Rivals", "Monkey Hat", "Single Team" and "Cold Flashes". In the first season, four teams competed, with CF joining in the third season. One of these teams, CF, never won the OCL, which makes sense since only four seasons have ended up with a winner.
