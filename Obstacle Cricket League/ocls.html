		A total of 4 OCL seasons have been played till now. Despite the game being called monthly, sometimes it is not started or cancelled because of inconviniency of ball. The first season had 6 matches and the latest had 16 matches. Each team competes with every other team at least once in the season (The third season had no MH vs US and UR vs CF). The first and third season had different ways to determine the winner i.e. the team at the top of the points table. But other than that, each season had m.o.m (made up matches) and the final.
