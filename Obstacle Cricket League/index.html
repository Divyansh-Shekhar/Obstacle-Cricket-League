		OCL i.e. Obstacle Cricket League is a monthly cricket league played in the balcony of the house of the owner Divyansh Shekhar. It is not like other cricket and also refered to as "Singleplayer cricket". It is played by placing the ball and stumps on specific places and then hitting the ball with the bat. If the ball hits the stumps just after being hit or while travelling back from a boundary, the batsman is given out. Different places where the ball hits or stops give different amount of runs such as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, or 18. The game uses compound runs system because if boundaries (3, 4, 6) are hit twice or thrice without coming in contact with the bat, the runs are counted twice or thrice which makes it possible for so many runs in 1 ball to be made. If the ball hits the stumps while travelling back after a boundary, the runs and wicket are counted in 1 ball only. If the ball hits the stumps and travels for a boundary, the runs and wicket are counted in 1 ball only. Each team has 18 balls and 3 wickets (opposition with <a href="/singleteam.html">Single Team</a> is different).
